By creating a Local Clone you will be able to create a copy of the repository that is avilable in your local computer.
In order to create a Local Clone follow the steps below: 
1.	Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository that you want to clone
2.	Click on the Code Button
3.	To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link
4.	Open Git Bash
5.	Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made
6.	Type git clone as shown in the example below and then paste the URL copied in Step 3
>$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
7. Press Enter 
8. Your local clone will be created

## **Credits**

Thanks to my Mentor, Narender Singh, for his guide and support for the realization of this project.
Thanks to the useful references and suggestions derived from the sources listed below, I manage to gain a deeper understanding of how the various elements/components of HTML, CSS and Javascript are used. In addition, continuous trial and error tests provided a useful means to further experiment on the usage of these three programming languages for the creation of the site.

- ### **Content & Media**
All of the contents on the application are customised and no design frameworks have been used for the realization of the site.
The idea of the Logo, the nav bar and the Footer were taken from the Love Running Project analysing and customizing their implementation for the created application and implementing an additional feature for the mobile version(Hamburger Menu).
In order to consolidate the knowledge acquired during the Code Institute Course dedicated to the javascript part (as well as the HTML and CSS), I have also studied and explored the writing part of the code and the best practices using the sites listed below. 
- [Medium.com](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
- [Learn.shayhowe.com](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)

One of the most complex part to develop for the application was the Quiz and the logic to apply. 
The following applications were inspirational and helped me understanding how to sctructure the logic on how to include the questions/answers and how to display them and let them be the element to click. I have customized and created my own code for my needs:
- [Thanks to Brian Design for the video of How to make a Quiz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4fB9Xg2JEY&t=1874s)
- [Thanks to Web Dev Simplfied for the video of How to build a Quiz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k&t=904s)
- [Thanks to Simple Step Code for the inspiration](https://simplestepscode.com/javascript-quiz-tutorial/)

Thanks to Narender Singh, who directed me toward the right path for the implementation of the Local Storage and Online NoSQL Database backend (RestDB.io). The implementation of those was customised and used to store information such us Username, Difficulty selected and Score. 
The API call and the usage of the Online NOSQL Database was one of the most complex part to develop but thanks to the Code Institute Course (Introduction to APIs) and the following application/Youtube Videos I was able to understand, customized and create the code:
- [Local Storage - W3School.com](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_win_localstorage.asp)
- [Thanks to dcode for the Video on How to use Local Storage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8yJCeuP6I8)

- [Thanks to Taniarascia.com for the API example](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-connect-to-an-api-with-javascript/)

To implement the favicon in the application the following resource was used:
- [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) 

For the realization of the 404 error page I found a guide on how to create the file here: 
- [Docs Github](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-custom-404-page-for-your-github-pages-site)

Thanks to Kasia Bogucka and Narender Singh for suggesting the use of github wiki site to create the Markdown file. They have also provided the link for the Sample Readme of Code Institute.

Thank you to the entire Code Institute Team and the Slack Community for their feedback, help and support. 

## Reminders

* Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
* Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
* Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

Happy coding!
