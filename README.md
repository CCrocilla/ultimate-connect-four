# **Connect 4** 

### **Developer: Claudio Crocilla**

## **Overview**

#### The application offers the possibility to play Connect 4! 
#### Connect 4 is a board game first invented in 1974, since then many players have tried to win by being the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens. Nowadays you can play online having the possibility of challenging a CPU when playing in single mode or friends in multiplayer mode.
#### The idea of this application is to provide a means to participate to a friendly competition, playing one of the most famous game in the world, Connect 4, granting the users a few relaxing but intense minutes to themselves.
#### The application is intuitive and user-friendly! The users can review the instructions and then play just entering their name and deciding if they want to play alone or with a friend! 
#### Good luck to everyone and enjoy this amazing Connect 4!

<!-- Design Area -->
## **Design**

#### The Application has been designed to provide a simple, interactive, clear and effective experience enabling the user to play a strategy game with a friend (in multiplayer mode) or alone against a CPU (single player) for a few relaxing but yet exciting moments.

- ### **Colour Scheme**
#### To provide the user with a good and positive impact at a first glance, when opening the application and through the entire experience, the Termcolor Module has been used colouring different parts of the text (depending if the CPU is playing/thinking or if a message is printed) with key colours in the terminal. The Module was used to render the boarding game equal to the original Connect 4 Board. 
#### The list of colours is chosen to be pleasing to the eyes providing an excellent contrast in the terminal to allow the user to have prolonged gaming hours without tiring the eyes. 
- ### **Colours Features** 
#### The colour used for the Logos is Red.
#### In each question, the key letters that the user needs to press have been highlighted with a different colour for easy usage of the application. 
#### The blue colour has been used for the board in order to replicate a realistic Connect 4.
#### Each coin used by the user is an emoji. The colour of the coins are yellow and red as in the real Connect 4 game.

<!-- Features Area -->
## **Features**
- ### *__Structure__*:

#### The Connect 4 created is a text base game realized in python that runs in a terminal. 
#### It has been structured in a simple, easy and user-friendly way providing a great experience to the user looking to play Connect 4 alone or against a friend. 
#### Structure of the application and the components used are listed below:
#### The first part of the Project has been dedicated to the creation of the wireframes, flow-chart and some drawing sketches made on Microsoft Whiteboard. These sketches provide a visual aid to understand all the programming steps undertaken for the realization of the project and the rationale behind those. 
####

<details>
    <summary>Click here to see the drawing sketches</summary>  
<img src="assets/images/drawing-sketches.webp" alt="Drawing Sketches Microsoft Whiteboard" width="1000px"/>
</details>

Each part and component used is listed below:

- ### *__Main menu__*:
#### The game starts showing the Main Menu to the user.
#### This displays the logo of the Application on the top left of the terminal followed by a welcome message.
#### The logo shows the name of the game ‚ÄúConnect 4‚Äù with visual effects of flames. The logo was generated with ASCII Art using the website [Patorjk.com](https://patorjk.com/software/taag).
#### The Logo has been placed in a txt file, content of which was read and displayed in the terminal by using the ‚Äúwith statement‚Äù and the ‚Äúopen function‚Äù and then displaying the content using the print() function in Python. 
#### The Termcolor Module has been used for both Logo and Welcome message and the colour red was utilized for display.
#### Right after the Welcome Message there is an input function. 
#### This function displays a message presenting the players with the possibility to type ‚ÄúP‚Äù to start playing the game or ‚ÄúI‚Äù to read the instructions.
#### The ‚Äúlower()‚Äù function has been integrated into the input to allow the user to type the required characters without having to mind the use of capitals vs lower letters. In this way, wherever the player types the letter, this will be always recognized by the software as uncapitalized.  
#### To provide a visual impact, the letters have been placed inside square brackets and highlighted using the Termcolor Module as can be seen in the image below: 

<details>
    <summary>Click here to see the image!</summary>  
<img src="assets/images/main-menu-view.webp" alt="Main Menu" width="1000px"/>
</details>

#### If the player types an incorrect value an error message is prompted bringing the user back to the selection for a correct choice.
#### Those behaviours are consistent in all parts of the application.


- ### *__Instructions__*:
#### In the Main Menu, when typing ‚ÄúI‚Äù, the instructions/rules of the game can be accessed.
#### The Instruction area displays a logo (‚ÄúInstructions‚Äù) on the top left of the terminal followed by the Instructions of the game. The logo and the message of this area mimic the display of the main page, they are represented in red for consistency, with flames arising from the logo (isn‚Äôt it hot to play this game?? üòÅ). 
#### As for the Main Menu the Instruction Logo and the Instructions have been placed in a txt files and displayed in the terminal using the ‚Äúwith‚Äù statement, the function ‚Äúopen‚Äù and the print() function. 
#### Once the Player is ready, he/she can press the Enter Key to go back to the Main Menu.
#### A clear() function was created to remove the content of the terminal once the Player presses the Enter Key, bringing the user back to the Main Menu. 
 

- ### *__Start Menu__*:
#### In the Main Menu, the user is able to access the Start Game Area by typing ‚ÄúP‚Äù. In this area the player can decide to play in Single or Multiplayer Mode (in the message displayed to the user the letters S and M have been highlighted). Once one of the options (S or M) is selected the Start Game will be prompted. 


- ### *__Start Game__*:
#### After the selection of the mode, the user will be asked to insert his/hers name.
#### This is saved in a List and it is used during the game. If the M (Multiplayer) is selected users can insert their name as player 1 and player 2.
#### Once the name is inserted, the terminal will show the user his/hers name associated with the player turn and an emoji (coin) either red or yellow.  
#### In Single Player Mode the user will play against a CPU called Roboto. 
#### Roboto represents an artificial intelligence (AI), defined in python with two functions used to investigate the board and the position of the placed coins horizontally and vertically placing the next move either to block the opponent or to attack when two coins of the same colours are adjacent.  
#### In Multiplayer Mode two humans will challenge each other.

#### The Players/Roboto can select the board desired position by indicating a number from 1 to 7 representing the columns (this is also displayed in a message printed into the board to provide a clear instructions to the players). Every time the Player/CPU makes a move, the coin is positioned at the lowest free space for that particular chosen column. This was designed in the code using a function that simulates the Gravity of the coins. For each new move a new board is rendered showing the placed coins. In addition, a message is displayed in the top section of the terminal summarising the move of the opponent (either from Roboto or the other human player). 
#### The game ends when one is able to place 4 consecutive coins either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
#### Once the player/cpu wins a message will display the name of the winner, the board is rendered in order to see the winning combination and a message will be prompt to the user asking to either try a rematch (by typing R) or exit the game (by typing E).

#### If a rematch is selected the board is re-set and the game starts again with the same players‚Äô configuration as per previous match.

The most complex part to develop for the Connect 4 application were the ‚ÄúGravity‚Äù of  the Coin, the logic to apply to check for the winner, and the generation  of the functions that let the CPU have an AI. 
The following applications were inspirational and helped me understanding how to structure the logic on the gravity of the coin entered in the table. 
I have customized and created my own code taking inspiration from:
